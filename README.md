# About the project

Idea of this project is to build a simple voting system web3 dapp with solidity contracts and implement a react UI to interact with theses contracts.

A github pipeline run solidity linter and run contracts tests after each git push.

After each git push, react app is deployed to netlify.

**Keywords:** DApp, Web3, Ethereum, solidity, React, hardhat, Ether.js

# Prerequisites:

- Install Metamask on your browser and connect your hardhat accounts

# Demo

I deployed my contract to Ropsten testnet and my React app with Netlify.

Go to see and test my app : <URL_OF_NETLIFY_REACT_APP>

# Run the project

## Deploy contract on localhost
